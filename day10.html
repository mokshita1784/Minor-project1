        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Redfortdelhi1.jpg/1200px-Redfortdelhi1.jpg" id="two">
        <p>The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is a historic fort complex located in the heart of Old Delhi, India. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century as the main residence for the Mughal emperors. The fort served as the political and ceremonial center of the Mughal Empire for nearly 200 years.

            The Red Fort gets its name from the red sandstone used in its construction, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The fort is surrounded by massive walls, which are about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) in perimeter. The complex houses numerous structures, including palaces, pavilions, gardens, and courtyards.
            
            One of the most notable structures within the Red Fort is the Diwan-i-Am, or the Hall of Public Audience, where the emperor would address the public and conduct important ceremonies.

            Every year on India's Independence Day, which is celebrated on August 15th, the Prime Minister of India hoists the national flag at the Red Fort and delivers a speech from its ramparts. This tradition has been carried out since India gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947.
            
            The Red Fort is not only a historical landmark but also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It attracts a large number of visitors who come to admire its impressive architecture, learn about Mughal history, and explore the various museums and exhibitions within the complex.</p>
